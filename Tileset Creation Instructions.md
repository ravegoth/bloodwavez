# Step 1
Get any images for whatever enemy/item you want to implement (doesn't matter what resolution they are)

# Step 2
Go to this website https://www.iloveimg.com/resize-image and put all of you images that you need to resize,
click "by pixels" and be sure to have "maintain aspect ratio" checked then put in "height" whatever
value from 32,64,128... click "resize images" and then download them.

# Step 3
Now download https://store.steampowered.com/app/1204050/Pixel_Studio__pixel_art_editor/ an open it.
Then pres escape and click "create new" put in the height that you put in at Step 2 and in width
the smallest number that is bigger than all of your pictures width (E.g. if you had p1x=50 p2x=60 p3x=64 and 
height=64 then you would put width 64) then click "next", "use simple template" and then bottom left 
click the + until you have enough slots for your pictures, then click the first one on the left and 
then click on the wrench bottom right then "Add image", "Open from Files" find your first picture
and add it, do the same for every slot until you have all of your pictures in a slot. (also clicking
on a slot when its white will turn the borders grey and turn off showing that layer).
After all of that click on the wrench again, then "Export Layers" then "Sprite Sheet" then checkmark and
you now have your set.
